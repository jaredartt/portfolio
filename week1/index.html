        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>In the PDF "Doing Stuff with Web Things" and reviewed (and learned) about how to play with LocalStorage and how to use it. This is a <a href="doing_stuff/story_editor.html">link</a> to the exercise I made following the PDF's guidelines. I learned how to create an article, save it into LocalStorage, and then be able to load it by finding it by title.</p> 

        <h3>Questions</h3>
